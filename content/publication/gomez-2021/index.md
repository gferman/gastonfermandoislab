abstract: © 2021 Elsevier Ltd This paper proposes an approach for the optimal design
  of nonlinear energy sinks (NES) installed in structures subjected to stochastic
  excitation. The response of these nonlinear systems subjected to stationary or non-stationary
  stochastic excitations has been characterized by the time-history of its covariance
  matrix. However, time-invariant equivalent linearization methods of NES equipped
  structures will not always converge due to its essential nonlinearity. A solution
  strategy is proposed using equivalent linearization at each time step of the governing
  matrix differential equation, obtained through a sequence of Lyapunov equations.
  The adequacy of this method for optimization problems is evaluated by comparison
  with Monte Carlo simulations of two representative NES examples. Moreover, the influence
  of the Gaussian assumption of the equivalent system response is studied in these
  examples. An optimization formulation to design systems equipped with NES devices
  is proposed, in which the performance function is defined in terms of the maximum
  variance over the time-history. This result is obtained by using the proposed method
  with a Gaussian assumption of the equivalent linear system. To illustrate the proposed
  methodology, parametric optimization of an NES installed at the top of a shear building
  structure is performed.
