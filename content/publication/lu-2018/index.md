abstract: Cables are prone to vibration due to their low inherent damping characteristics.
  Recently, negative stiffness dampers have gained attentions, because of their promising
  energy dissipation ability. The viscous inertial mass damper (termed as VIMD hereinafter)
  can be viewed as one realization of the inerter. It is formed by paralleling an
  inertial mass part with a common energy dissipation element (e.g., viscous element)
  and able to provide pseudo-negative stiffness properties to flexible systems such
  as cables. A previous study examined the potential of IMD to enhance the damping
  of stay cables. Because there are already models for common energy dissipation elements,
  the key to establish a general model for IMD is to propose an analytical model of
  the rotary mass component. In this paper, the characteristics of the rotary mass
  and the proposed analytical model have been evaluated by the numerical and experimental
  tests. First, a series of harmonic tests are conducted to show the performance and
  properties of the IMD only having the rotary mass. Then, the mechanism of nonlinearities
  is analyzed, and an analytical model is introduced and validated by comparing with
  the experimental data. Finally, a real-time hybrid simulation test is conducted
  with a physical IMD specimen and cable numerical substructure under distributed
  sinusoidal excitation. The results show that the chosen model of the rotary mass
  part can provide better estimation on the damper's performance, and it is better
  to use it to form a general analytical model of IMD. On the other hand, the simplified
  damper model is accurate for the preliminary simulation of the cable responses.
