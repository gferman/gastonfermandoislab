summary:
abstract: "Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is an efficient and cost-effective experimental testing technique for performance evaluation of structural systems subjected to dynamic loading (e.g., wind and earthquakes) and with rate-dependent components. When structural components are subjected to multi-axial loading, multiple actuators are essential to impose realistic boundary conditions over the physical specimens in the laboratory. However, this loading assembly will exhibit significant dynamic actuator coupling and suffer from synchronization errors and potential instabilities during the test execution.

In this talk, we examine multi-actuator techniques to conduct multi-axial RTHS (or maRTHS), focusing on revealing the latest breakthroughs and current challenges. In particular, we explain the framework for three-dimensional testing, including advanced topics in multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) modeling of dynamic systems, multi-actuator control, nonlinear kinematics, and force measurements.

Finally, two maRTHS experiments will be presented using centralized and decentralized multivariate control approaches for dynamic compensation. This webinar is part of the series, Hybrid Simulation 201, being organized by the Multi-hazard Engineering Collaboratory on Hybrid Simulation [MECHS] virtual community (see: https://mechs.designsafe-ci.org)."
