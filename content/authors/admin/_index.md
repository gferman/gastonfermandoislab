Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Civil Engineering](http://obrasciviles.usm.cl) at [Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria (USM)](https://www.usm.cl) at Santiago de Chile since 2011. I hold a B.S. and M.S. in Civil Engineering from USM at Valparaiso, and a Ph.D. in Structural Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Billie F. Spencer, Jr](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/bfs). My research interests are structural control, experimental testing, real-time hybrid simulation, random vibrations, earthquake engineering, steel design, and structural optimization, among others.

I am a member of the Chilean Association of Seismology and Earthquake Engineering (ACHISINA), and a member of the [Structural Health Monitoring & Control Committee](https://www.asce.org/templates/membership-communities-committee-detail.aspx?committeeid=000000885217) from ASCE Engineering Mechanics Institute (EMI). I was awarded with the CONICYT “Becas Chile” Scholarship, the Fulbright Foreign Fellowship from the United States Department of State, and USM Faculty Development Scholarship.
