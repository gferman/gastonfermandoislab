The website has been updated with the following information:

- New group members have been added to the People section.
- New slides from past presentations were added in the Talks section.

Also, we'd like to acknowledge the papers submitted by Maria Quiroz, Diego Mera, and Cristobal Galmez to the 17th World Conference in Earthquake Engineering (17WCEE), a hybrid conference held in Sendai, Japan, this past September 2021. We're very proud of the work presented by our research group and looking forward to our future participation in the next 18WCEE in Milan, Italy, in 2024!

Best, G.
