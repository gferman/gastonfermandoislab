abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd This paper proposes an approach for the optimal design of nonlinear energy sinks (NES) installed in structures subjected to stochastic excitation. The response of these nonlinear systems subjected to stationary or non-stationary stochastic excitations has been characterized by the time-history of its covariance matrix. However, time-invariant equivalent linearization methods of NES equipped structures will not always converge due to its essential nonlinearity. A solution strategy is proposed using equivalent linearization at each time step of the governing matrix differential equation, obtained through a sequence of Lyapunov equations. The adequacy of this method for optimization problems is evaluated by comparison with Monte Carlo simulations of two representative NES examples. Moreover, the influence of the Gaussian assumption of the equivalent system response is studied in these examples. An optimization formulation to design systems equipped with NES devices is proposed, in which the performance function is defined in terms of the maximum variance over the time-history. This result is obtained by using the proposed method with a Gaussian assumption of the equivalent linear system. To illustrate the proposed methodology, parametric optimization of an NES installed at the top of a shear building structure is performed.},

abstract = {Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is a cost and space efficient alternative to shake table testing for seismic assessment of structural systems. In this method, complete structural systems are partitioned into numerical and physical components and tested at real earthquake velocities. Well-understood components of the structure are modeled in finite-element numerical models. Meanwhile, the physical substructure, which often contains the highly nonlinear and numerically burdensome components is fabricated and tested in a laboratory facility. Testing at real earthquake velocities is useful to obtain nonlinear rate-dependent material behaviors. Realistic reproduction of seismic conditions for structural assessment has required researchers to develop multi-axial RTHS capabilities. In such developments, multiple actuators are arranged at the boundary condition with the physical specimen to impose realistic displacements and rotations. But, varying degrees of dynamic coupling exist between the actuators in multi-axial boundary conditions. Controllers and kinematic transformations are developed for the tracking action of the actuators to compensate for the amplitude and phase discrepancies between target and measured displacement signals, otherwise stability issues are likely to result. In this paper, a multi-axial framework is introduced for RTHS testing, using a Load and Boundary Condition Box (LBCB) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The previously developed multi-axial RTHS framework for the LBCBs compensates for actuator dynamics in Cartesian coordinates; this approach lacked stability robustness when testing stiff specimens. The distinguishing feature of the proposed framework is that tracking compensation is executed in the actuator coordinates. The differences between the previous and proposed multi-axial RTHS frameworks are explored in detail herein. This paper presents the components of the framework and the describes a six-degree-of-freedom moment frame RTHS experiment. Finally, experimental results are discussed and directions for future research efforts are considered.},

abstract = {Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is an experimental testing technique widely used for performance evaluation of structural systems such as large buildings and bridges subjected to earthquake loading. While RTHS testing has demonstrated over the last 20 years to be an efficient and cost-effective alternative to shaking table tests, especially for large structural systems with rate-dependent behavior, accurate and stable results from this methodology are highly dependent on the test specimen, loading equipment, and controller design for dynamic compensation. This paper presents a study on the accuracy and stability of model-based compensation (MBC) approaches for the implementation of a real-time hybrid simulation benchmark problem. The controller architecture is based on feedforward compensator, designed for reference tracking, while a feedback regulator provides improved robustness for undesired disturbance and sensor noise. The results provide evidence of the improved performance of MBC controllers compared to benchmark results. Moreover, the MBC controllers surpass the benchmark controller in terms of robustness, when multiple partitioning cases and control plant uncertainty are considered in the numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Real-time hybrid simulation is an efficient and cost-effective experimental testing technique for performance evaluation of structural systems subjected to earthquake loading with rate-dependent behavior. To assess the response of structural components with multi-axial loading, a loading assembly with multiple parallel actuators connected to a rigid moving platform is required to impose realistic boundary conditions on physical components. This loading assembly is expected to exhibit significant dynamic actuator coupling and suffer from systematic errors and potential instabilities. One approach to reduce experimental errors considers a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) modeling approach to design controllers that could compensate for these undesired effects. In this dissertation, a framework for three-dimensional, multi-axial real-time hybrid simulation is presented. The methodology consists in designing a real-time system platform to perform dynamic test experiments by controlling the interface boundary conditions on the physical specimen in Cartesian (global) coordinates. First, a kinematic transformation is derived to impose the six-degree-of-freedom motion to the loading platform in three-dimensional Cartesian space. Then, a linearized model of the multi-actuator loading assembly is obtained through nonparametric frequency domain system identification techniques. Subsequently, a feedforward-feedback compensator is developed for reference tracking of the multivariate transient signals, which should be sufficiently robust to rule out any disturbances and measurement noises in the experimental closed-loop system. Finally, the numerical substructure, compensators, and kinematic transformations are implemented over an embedded system with a micro-controller unit and digital signal processing capabilities for real-time applications. The proposed framework is validated using a small-scale version of the Load and Boundary Condition Box (LBCB) from Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. A one-story, two-bay, moment frame was considered as the reference structure, where the experimental substructure was chosen as a steel column with fixed ends. The hybrid system was subjected to earthquake ground motions chosen according to its importance and destructive characteristics. Comparisons of different compensation strategies are made, and excellent performance is achieved for all situations that incorporates the multivariate controller.},

abstract = {Cables are prone to vibration due to their low inherent damping characteristics. Recently, negative stiffness dampers have gained attentions, because of their promising energy dissipation ability. The viscous inertial mass damper (termed as VIMD hereinafter) can be viewed as one realization of the inerter. It is formed by paralleling an inertial mass part with a common energy dissipation element (e.g., viscous element) and able to provide pseudo-negative stiffness properties to flexible systems such as cables. A previous study examined the potential of IMD to enhance the damping of stay cables. Because there are already models for common energy dissipation elements, the key to establish a general model for IMD is to propose an analytical model of the rotary mass component. In this paper, the characteristics of the rotary mass and the proposed analytical model have been evaluated by the numerical and experimental tests. First, a series of harmonic tests are conducted to show the performance and properties of the IMD only having the rotary mass. Then, the mechanism of nonlinearities is analyzed, and an analytical model is introduced and validated by comparing with the experimental data. Finally, a real-time hybrid simulation test is conducted with a physical IMD specimen and cable numerical substructure under distributed sinusoidal excitation. The results show that the chosen model of the rotary mass part can provide better estimation on the damper's performance, and it is better to use it to form a general analytical model of IMD. On the other hand, the simplified damper model is accurate for the preliminary simulation of the cable responses.},

abstract = {A stochastic optimisation procedure is proposed for the design of low- and mid-rise buckling restrained braced frames subject to seismic loading. The seismic excitation is represented as a zero-mean nonstationary filtered white noise. The Bouc?Wen model is chosen to represent the hysteretic behaviour of the buckling restrained braces. The equivalent linearisation method is employed to determine the second-order statistics of structural responses from the non-linear system. Three seismic intensity levels are considered in this study, which are associated to earthquakes with different probability of occurrence during the building?s lifecycle. It was observed that the optimal design that minimises the maximum ductility demand produces a more uniform distribution of energy dissipation and avoids soft-storey mechanisms; therefore, this design objective is considered to be a more reasonable optimisation objective for the design of buckling restrained braced frames. For higher rise structures, buckling restrained braces may experience over-dimensioning in the top stories, which means that dissipation will not occur. Thus, an upper bound constraint for the stiffness design of the buckling restrained braces is taken into account.},

abstract = {Buckling-Restrained Braces are structural members that are able to yield not only in tension but also in compression. The key to obtain this desirable behavior is to avoid the occurrence of buckling when the element is subjected to compression forces. The result is a member that shows a stable hysteretic behavior and an excellent low-cycle fatigue life compared to a conventional brace. This work encourages the use of Steel Braced Frames with Buckling-Restrained Braces in the design of new building structures and the retrofit of existing structures in Chile. In order to achieve this, a complete state-of-the-art review is presented, which is complemented with a comparative cost analysis in order to demonstrate the advantages of the use of BRBs instead of conventional braces. Subsequently, five different buildings using Buckling-Restrained Braced Frames with the same tipology and different number of stories (between 4 to 24) are analyzed and designed using the Chilean Standard NCh433.Of96: Earthquake Resistant Design of Buildings, along with the corresponding requirements of AISC 2005 Seismic Provisions. Afterwards, the structural capacity and demand for each building is determined by inelastic analysis, using earthquake records selected according to their importance and destructive characteristics observed over the last 30 years. Finally, the seismic response modification coefficients are obtained and compared to the proposed coefficients for steel moment frames in the Chilean seismic code. From this comparison, seismic response coefficients are suggested to be incorporated on the corresponding chilean standard.},

abstract = {Real-time hybrid simulation is an efficient and cost-effective dynamic testing technique for performance evaluation of structural systems subjected to earthquake loading with rate-dependent behavior. A loading assembly with multiple actuators is required to impose realistic boundary conditions on physical specimens. However, such a testing system is expected to exhibit significant dynamic coupling of the actuators and suffer from time lags that are associated with the dynamics of the servo-hydraulic system, as well as control-structure interaction (CSI). One approach to reducing experimental errors considers a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) controller design, yielding accurate reference tracking and noise rejection. In this paper, a framework for multi-axial real-time hybrid simulation (maRTHS) testing is presented. The methodology employs a real-time feedback-feedforward controller for multiple actuators commanded in Cartesian coordinates. Kinematic transformations between actuator space and Cartesian space are derived for all six-degrees-offreedom of the moving platform. Then, a frequency domain identification technique is used to develop an accurate MIMO transfer function of the system. Further, a Cartesian-domain model-based feedforward-feedback controller is implemented for time lag compensation and to increase the robustness of the reference tracking for given model uncertainty. The framework is implemented using the 1/5th-scale Load and Boundary Condition Box (LBCB) located at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, a single-story frame subjected to earthquake loading is tested. One of the columns in the frame is represented physically in the laboratory as a cantilevered steel column. For realtime execution, the numerical substructure, kinematic transformations, and controllers are implemented on a digital signal processor. Results show excellent performance of the maRTHS framework when six-degrees-of-freedom are controlled at the interface between substructures.},
