abstract = {Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is a cost and space efficient alternative to shake table testing for seismic assessment of structural systems. In this method, complete structural systems are partitioned into numerical and physical components and tested at real earthquake velocities. Well-understood components of the structure are modeled in finite-element numerical models. Meanwhile, the physical substructure, which often contains the highly nonlinear and numerically burdensome components is fabricated and tested in a laboratory facility. Testing at real earthquake velocities is useful to obtain nonlinear rate-dependent material behaviors. Realistic reproduction of seismic conditions for structural assessment has required researchers to develop multi-axial RTHS capabilities. In such developments, multiple actuators are arranged at the boundary condition with the physical specimen to impose realistic displacements and rotations. But, varying degrees of dynamic coupling exist between the actuators in multi-axial boundary conditions. Controllers and kinematic transformations are developed for the tracking action of the actuators to compensate for the amplitude and phase discrepancies between target and measured displacement signals, otherwise stability issues are likely to result. In this paper, a multi-axial framework is introduced for RTHS testing, using a Load and Boundary Condition Box (LBCB) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The previously developed multi-axial RTHS framework for the LBCBs compensates for actuator dynamics in Cartesian coordinates; this approach lacked stability robustness when testing stiff specimens. The distinguishing feature of the proposed framework is that tracking compensation is executed in the actuator coordinates. The differences between the previous and proposed multi-axial RTHS frameworks are explored in detail herein. This paper presents the components of the framework and the describes a six-degree-of-freedom moment frame RTHS experiment. Finally, experimental results are discussed and directions for future research efforts are considered.},

abstract = {Cables are prone to vibration due to their low inherent damping characteristics. Recently, negative stiffness dampers have gained attentions, because of their promising energy dissipation ability. The viscous inertial mass damper (termed as VIMD hereinafter) can be viewed as one realization of the inerter. It is formed by paralleling an inertial mass part with a common energy dissipation element (e.g., viscous element) and able to provide pseudo-negative stiffness properties to flexible systems such as cables. A previous study examined the potential of IMD to enhance the damping of stay cables. Because there are already models for common energy dissipation elements, the key to establish a general model for IMD is to propose an analytical model of the rotary mass component. In this paper, the characteristics of the rotary mass and the proposed analytical model have been evaluated by the numerical and experimental tests. First, a series of harmonic tests are conducted to show the performance and properties of the IMD only having the rotary mass. Then, the mechanism of nonlinearities is analyzed, and an analytical model is introduced and validated by comparing with the experimental data. Finally, a real-time hybrid simulation test is conducted with a physical IMD specimen and cable numerical substructure under distributed sinusoidal excitation. The results show that the chosen model of the rotary mass part can provide better estimation on the damper's performance, and it is better to use it to form a general analytical model of IMD. On the other hand, the simplified damper model is accurate for the preliminary simulation of the cable responses.},

abstract = {Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is an experimental testing technique widely used for performance evaluation of structural systems such as large buildings and bridges subjected to earthquake loading. While RTHS testing has demonstrated over the last 20 years to be an efficient and cost-effective alternative to shaking table tests, especially for large structural systems with rate-dependent behavior, accurate and stable results from this methodology are highly dependent on the test specimen, loading equipment, and controller design for dynamic compensation. This paper presents a study on the accuracy and stability of model-based compensation (MBC) approaches for the implementation of a real-time hybrid simulation benchmark problem. The controller architecture is based on feedforward compensator, designed for reference tracking, while a feedback regulator provides improved robustness for undesired disturbance and sensor noise. The results provide evidence of the improved performance of MBC controllers compared to benchmark results. Moreover, the MBC controllers surpass the benchmark controller in terms of robustness, when multiple partitioning cases and control plant uncertainty are considered in the numerical simulations.},

abstract = {A stochastic optimisation procedure is proposed for the design of low- and mid-rise buckling restrained braced frames subject to seismic loading. The seismic excitation is represented as a zero-mean nonstationary filtered white noise. The Bouc?Wen model is chosen to represent the hysteretic behaviour of the buckling restrained braces. The equivalent linearisation method is employed to determine the second-order statistics of structural responses from the non-linear system. Three seismic intensity levels are considered in this study, which are associated to earthquakes with different probability of occurrence during the building?s lifecycle. It was observed that the optimal design that minimises the maximum ductility demand produces a more uniform distribution of energy dissipation and avoids soft-storey mechanisms; therefore, this design objective is considered to be a more reasonable optimisation objective for the design of buckling restrained braced frames. For higher rise structures, buckling restrained braces may experience over-dimensioning in the top stories, which means that dissipation will not occur. Thus, an upper bound constraint for the stiffness design of the buckling restrained braces is taken into account.},

abstract = {Real-time hybrid simulation is an efficient and cost-effective dynamic testing technique for performance evaluation of structural systems subjected to earthquake loading with rate-dependent behavior. A loading assembly with multiple actuators is required to impose realistic boundary conditions on physical specimens. However, such a testing system is expected to exhibit significant dynamic coupling of the actuators and suffer from time lags that are associated with the dynamics of the servo-hydraulic system, as well as control-structure interaction (CSI). One approach to reducing experimental errors considers a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) controller design, yielding accurate reference tracking and noise rejection. In this paper, a framework for multi-axial real-time hybrid simulation (maRTHS) testing is presented. The methodology employs a real-time feedback-feedforward controller for multiple actuators commanded in Cartesian coordinates. Kinematic transformations between actuator space and Cartesian space are derived for all six-degrees-offreedom of the moving platform. Then, a frequency domain identification technique is used to develop an accurate MIMO transfer function of the system. Further, a Cartesian-domain model-based feedforward-feedback controller is implemented for time lag compensation and to increase the robustness of the reference tracking for given model uncertainty. The framework is implemented using the 1/5th-scale Load and Boundary Condition Box (LBCB) located at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, a single-story frame subjected to earthquake loading is tested. One of the columns in the frame is represented physically in the laboratory as a cantilevered steel column. For realtime execution, the numerical substructure, kinematic transformations, and controllers are implemented on a digital signal processor. Results show excellent performance of the maRTHS framework when six-degrees-of-freedom are controlled at the interface between substructures.},
